## (Sway + Waybar + Wofi + Foot) config files
These are my personal configuration files for **Sway**, **Waybar**, **foot** and **Wofi**.  

I use these configs to customize my tiling window manager setup, including:  
- Sway layout and keybindings  
- Waybar status bar with custom styling  
- Wofi application launcher

> âš¡ **Note:** This setup is intentionally **clean, minimal, and simple**, focusing on usability and efficiency rather than flashy visuals. It's a great starting point for anyone learning Sway and its ecosystem.


## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/notthatmojo/sway-config.git

2. Copy the configs to your ~/.config folder:
- cp -r sway-config/sway ~/.config/
- cp -r sway-config/waybar ~/.config/
- cp -r sway-config/wofi ~/.config/
- cp -r sway-config/foot ~/.config/

3. Reload Sway to apply changes:
Ctrl+Shift+C or in the terminal "swaymsg relaod"
